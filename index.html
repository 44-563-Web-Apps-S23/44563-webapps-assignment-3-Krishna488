<h3>Chess</h3>
<p> Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called international
     chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi
      (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The current form of the game emerged
       in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century
        after evolving from <b>chaturanga</b>, a similar but much older game of Indian origin.
         Today, <b>chess</b> is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide. <b>sport</b>    (<b> </b> this is used to bold)

    <h2>Trip</h2>
    <p> My Favorite Family Vacation Spot As soon as I got of the plane and breathed in that City air I new my life would change for the better. I was waiting for this day for the past several months. It was the first time I would go with my father and brothers on their “Boys Only Vacation”. I was thrilled at the fact that they would finally let me tag along with them.</p>
